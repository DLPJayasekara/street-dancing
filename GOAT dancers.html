       <h1>BEST STREET DANCERS IN  THE WORLD</h1>

       <p>It is nearly impossible to accurately rank the top street dancers in the world, as each has their own distinct style and talent.

        <p>While there are many skilled street dancers today, some have made a particularly significant contribution to the hip-hop scene and have become a part of its history. These iconic figures in hip-hop dance culture are widely recognized and respected within the professional dance community.

        <p>Therefore in order to broaden understanding of dance culture in general, we have created this list of the best and most popular freestyle, hip-hop, and break dancers in the world. This is not a ranking, and we have not given anyone a place. We merely offer to get acquainted with the iconic figures as one of the best hiphop dancers. So let’s begin!

Later on, Buddha Stretch assembled a dance team of the best freestyle dancers named Elite Force and even worked with the most popular artists of the world.
                    While Buddha himself says he never planned to pursue dance and hip-hop professionally, it became so all-encompassing that it completely consumed him
